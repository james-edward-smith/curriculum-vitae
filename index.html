                <p>From cradle to grave, I spent nearly eight years at one of the UKâ€™s largest and most exciting tech startups, where I developed game-changing automotive products, from components to software. My journey catapulted me from lead engineer to director level, a progression I attribute to being in an environment that allowed me to leverage my skills, take a hands-on technical approach, and provide leadership.</p>
                <p>I specialized in all aspects of electrical system design, from concept through to manufacturing, notably with powertrain, EDS, control systems, connectivity, and ADAS. Applying agile methodologies, I coordinated and led medium-sized teams of engineers, developing and implementing maturity frameworks for hardware and software to meet stringent legislative requirements, while ensuring systems were delivered on time and within budget. As a director, I expanded my responsibilities to include investor relations, creating and presenting business cases to meet unique customer requirements and deliver tangible outcomes.</p>            
                <p>Reflecting on my early career, I value the core development methodologies I built in various roles at long-established OEMs, which provided me with a strong foundation in development and manufacturing.</p>
