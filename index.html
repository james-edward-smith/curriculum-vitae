                <p class="c25">
                    From cradle to grave, I spent nearly 8 years at one of the UKâ€™s largest and most exciting tech startup offerings, Arrival.
                    Developing game-changing automotive products from components to software, my journey has catapulted me from lead engineer all the way up to director level. I attribute this to being in the right environment where I could utilise my skills to get technically hands-on and lead others to the delivery of successful products.
                    Specialising in all aspects of electrical system design from concept through to manufacturing; powertrain, EDS, power electronics, control systems, connectivity, ADAS, and more.
                </p>
                <p class="c25">
                    I applied agile methodology to coordinate and lead medium-sized teams of engineers, developing and implementing maturity frameworks for both hardware and software to meet the most stringent legislative requirements while ensuring that our systems were delivered on time and to cost. In my role as director, I turned my hand to investor relations, playing a crucial role in the creation and presentation of business cases to satisfy unique customer requirements and provide tangible solutions for returns on investment.
